	* extract.c (extract): Properly fail if we cannot parse a secret
	subkey packet.  Discovered by Osamu Aoki and Peter Palfrader.

	* parse.c (extract_secrets): Add support for EdDSA as per
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-eddsa-for-openpgp-04.  Note
	that this is an expired draft, but GnuPG is using algorithm 22 for
	it.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Post-release commit.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Preparing 1.4 release.

	* NEWS, output.h, output.c, paperkey.c (set_binary_mode): Fix
	binary vs text output mismatch when using "--output-type raw" on
	Windows platforms.  Does not affect any non-Windows platforms.
	Found by Thierry Ambrus.

	* README: Clarify output-width a bit.

	* paperkey.spec.in: Use %license for the COPYING file and run the
	self checks during build.

2016-09-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* README: PowerPC Macs are basically gone, so remove the OSX
	(sorry: macOS!) universal binary stuff.

2013-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Post-release commit.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Preparing 1.3 release.

2012-11-29  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* checks/roundtrip.sh, checks/roundtrip-raw.sh: Use /bin/echo as
	some shell builtin echoes don't understand "echo -n".

	* checks: Add tests for RSA and ECC keys.

	* output.c (output_openpgp_header): Use the same "tag under 16,
	use old-style packets" as other OpenPGP programs.  It's crazy to
	have a roundtrip test that doesn't compare the result with the
	input.

2012-06-13  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse.c (extract_secrets): Add support for ECDH and ECDSA as per

	be creating files that contain secret key material.

	* paperkey.1, paperkey.c (main, usage): Add -o as alias to
	--output, and document -h (help), -V (version), and -v (verbose).

	binary.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Post-release commit.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Preparing 1.1 release.

	* paperkey.1: Don't mention the README file.  It's not really
	necessary here, and not all platfoms install it.  Noted by Todd
	Zullinger.

	* output.c (output_file_format, output_start): Some file format
	documentation tweaks.

2009-01-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

2009-01-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* paperkey.c (main): --version strings from autoconf.

	* configure.ac: autoupdate, and some m4 magic so we can propagate
	the copyright line into config.h.

	* paperkey.spec.in: Borrow some RPM-fu from the Fedora RPM by Todd
	Zullinger.

	* output.c (output_file_format): Clarify we're all big endian
	here.  Noted by Frédéric Brière.

2009-01-14  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am: Autogenerate paperkey.txt from paperkey.1 when
	cross compiling.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Don't run selftest when cross
	compiling.

	* Makefile.am: When cross compiling for Win32, add README.WIN32, a
	regular text file version of the man page, and the Win32 binary.

	* README: Clarify what universal binaries are good for.

	* configure.ac: Add "-win32" to dist version string when cross
	compiling.

	* README.WIN32: New.

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Preparing 0.8 release.

2008-01-31  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* parse.c (read_secrets_file): Skip \r lines as well for Win32.

	* NEWS: Update for 0.8: --file-format, --comment, and SHA-1 fixes.

2007-11-01  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* output.h, output.c (output_file_format): New function to print
	our file format into the archive.

	* paperkey.c (main), output.c (output_start): Use it here.
	Suggested by Brendan Kidwell.

2007-10-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* configure.ac: NEWS: Post-release commit.

	* README, configure.ac, NEWS: Preparing 0.7 release.

2007-09-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* paperkey.c (main): There is no such thing as an "auto"
	--output-type.

	* parse.c (parse): Just in case, check for a short read on the
	packet.

2007-09-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* AUTHORS, Makefile.am, paperkey.spec.in, paperkey.1: Add man page
	thanks to Peter Palfrader.

	* restore.h, restore.c (restore): Pass in secrets FILE* from
	outside.  Don't do the reopen-as-text trickery since even Win32
	doesn't need it.
	paperkey.c (main): Call it from here.  This allows for secrets to
	come in on stdin.

2007-09-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* configure.ac, NEWS: Release version 0.6.

	* output.h, output.c (do_crc24): Better CRC24 implementation.
	parse.c (read_secrets_file), output.c (output_bytes): Call it
	here.

	* README: Bar codes, of course, have many of the disadvantages of
	non-human-readable media.

	* paperkey.c (usage): Options.

	* parse.c (read_secrets_file), output.c (output_finish,
	output_bytes, print_base16): Add a CRC on RAW output as well.
	(parse): Note that we don't support armored data.

	* NEWS, README: Update.

	* parse.c (read_secrets_file), output.c (print_base16): Add an
	overall CRC that covers the whole secrets file.

	* output.c (output_length16): Fix sizing bug.  Thanks to Peter
	Palfrader.
	(output_start): Show what version of paperkey generated a given
	file.

	* extract.c (extract), restore.c (extract_keys): Include a version
	number in the secrets, in case the format needs to change in the
	future.

	* restore.c (extract_keys): Some more rigorous consistency
	checking when pulling apart the secret image.  It's possible that
	OCR or the like mangled it.

	* parse.c (extract_secrets): We're not going to support v3 keys.

	* restore.c (restore): Properly handle extracting a public key out
	from a large keyring so we can just pass our pubring directly to
	--pubring.

	* packets.h, output.c, output.h, extract.c, parse.c, parse.h,
	extract.h, paperkey.c, restore.c, restore.h, packets.c: Add
	copyright statements (oops).  Thanks to Peter Palfrader.
